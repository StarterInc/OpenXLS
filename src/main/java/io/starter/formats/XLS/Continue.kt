    /**
     * The SST record is the Shared String Table record,
     * and will contain the strings of text from cells of the worksheet.
     * For Excel 97, Excel 2000, Excel 2002 the size of this record is
     * limited to 8224 bytes of data, including the formatting runs
     * and string-length information. Shared string data that exceeds
     * this limit will be stored in a CONTINUE record. When the last
     * string in the SST must be broken into two segments, and the
     * last segment stored as the first data in the CONTINUE record,
     * that segment may be stored as either compressed or uncompressed
     * Unicode. Consequently, the first byte of the data will contain 00h or 01h.
     * This is a one-byte field called a grbit field. It is not part of the string segment.
     *
     *
     * The grbit flag value 00h says no bytes of the data need
     * Unicode high-order byte data, so all are stored as compressed Unicode
     * (all the high-order bytes of the Unicode representation of the data
     * characters have been stripped. They all contained 00h, so Excel manages
     * the logic of restoring that high-order information when it loads the record.)
     *
     *
     * Where any character in the data segment requires Unicode
     * high-order byte information, the grbit flag will be 01h,
     * and all characters in the string segment will be two-byte,
     * uncompressed Unicode.
